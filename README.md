### Hey, I'm Dana

**About me:**<br /><br />
Founder & full-stack developer building web applications that actually work well. I get excited about clean interfaces and shipping products that solve real problems without unnecessary complexity. Currently working on AI-powered tools and web apps that help people get things done.
<br /><br />
**Technical skills:**<br /><br />
Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, JavaScript

UI Libraries: Tailwind CSS  

Backend: Supabase, PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, Python 

Auth: Supabase Auth (magic links, RLS, JWTs)  

Deploy: Railway, Vercel, GitHub Actions  

AI: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini  

Other: Zustand, Zod, TanStack Query, GraphQL
<br /><br />
**OSS favorites:**  <br />
- 🌐 [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) – full-stack React framework that just works  
- 🧙‍♂️ [Supabase](https://supabase.com) – open-source backend with excellent developer experience  
- 🚂 [Railway](https://railway.app) – quick deploys without the DevOps headaches  
- ▲ [Vercel](https://vercel.com) – seamless Next.js deployments and edge functions  
- 🎨 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) – utility-first styling that makes sense  
- 📦 [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) – data fetching that handles the messy bits  
- 🔍 [Zod](https://zod.dev) – runtime validation that catches issues early
<br />

🧪 Testing Remix for its loader-based fetch model and routing. Might beat Next.js for the kind of micro-apps I'm building.
