**About me:**<br /><br />
Hey, I'm Dana. I'm Front-end/Full-stack UX focused developer who builds accessible apps with React, Next.js and TypeScript.  
I work across the stack when needed, mostly with Node.js and Supabase, and care about clean code, smooth UX and shipping things that work.  
Currently building AI-powered tools with OpenAI and Anthropic APIs, exploring how agents and embeddings can make products more useful.
<br /><br />

**Technical skills:**<br /><br />
**Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, JavaScript  

**UI Libraries:** Tailwind CSS  

**Backend:** Node.js, Supabase, PostgreSQL, Edge Functions, Python  

**Auth:** Supabase Auth (magic links, RLS, JWTs)  

**AI:** OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Vector Databases, Agents  

**State Management:** Zustand, TanStack Query  

**Payments:** Stripe  

**Validation:** Zod  

**Deploy:** Railway, Vercel, GitHub Actions  

**Design:** Figma  

**Other:** Git, GraphQL


<br /><br />
**OSS favorites:**  <br />
- 🌐 [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) – full-stack React framework that just works  
- 🧙‍♂️ [Supabase](https://supabase.com) – open-source backend with excellent developer experience  
- 🚂 [Railway](https://railway.app) – quick deploys without the DevOps headaches  
- ▲ [Vercel](https://vercel.com) – seamless Next.js deployments and edge functions  
- 🎨 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) – utility-first styling that makes sense  
- 📦 [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) – data fetching that handles the messy bits  
- 🔍 [Zod](https://zod.dev) – runtime validation that catches issues early
<br />

🧪 Testing Remix for its loader-based fetch model and routing. Might beat Next.js for the kind of micro-apps I'm building.
