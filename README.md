### Hey, I'm Dana

## About Me

Front-end-focused developer with 12 years’ experience building fast, accessible and visually polished web applications.  
I work across the stack — from React and Next.js on the front end to Python and Supabase on the backend — with a strong focus on user experience, maintainable systems and clean design.  
Currently exploring AI-powered interfaces using OpenAI and Anthropic APIs, with a focus on practical, real-world product applications.

**OSS favorites:**  <br />

- 🎨 [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) – utility-first styling that makes sense

- 🔍 [Zod](https://zod.dev) – runtime validation that catches issues early
<br />

🧪 Testing Remix for its loader-based fetch model and routing. Might beat Next.js for the kind of micro-apps I'm building.
